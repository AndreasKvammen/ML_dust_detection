The folder "SVM_train_and_test" contains the MatLab code to train and test the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The folder contains the following files:
  1. extract_SVM_features.m - is the MatLab code to extract the 2D feature vector from the training and testing data.
  2. SVM_dust_detection.m - is the MatLab script to run the training and testing of the SVM, based on the extracted feature vectors. 
  3. SVM_dust_detection.pdf - presents the MatLab code and resulting plots in pdf format 

The SVM achieved a 94\%± 1\% average class-wise accuracy and a 90\%± 3\% precision, trained and tested over 10 runs with randomly selected training and testing data sets.
